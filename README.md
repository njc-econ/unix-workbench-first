What is in a *name*?
Does it hold **meaning**?
Are we defined by what we are called?

A ***name*** is just a name
It is a word that we respond to
We are defined by what we do
Not by what we are called by

These three things do partly define me:

1. Tottenham fan
2. Speaker of 3-4 languages
3. Coder in multiple languages

These things are not associated with me:

- Arsenal
- Bayern MÃ¼nchen
- Barcelona
